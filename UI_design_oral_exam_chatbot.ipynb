The user should pick or it should be inherent if there is no upload of questions. Note that we must also allow for context to be uploaded (vector store, vector store link, specific documents)\n",

Jonathan Wade will be interning Mondays and Wednesdays 2-5 pm and Fridays 12-4 pm starting Monday, January 31st. Jessica will be job coaching on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2-5 pm. It also used to be on Fridays from 2-4 pm but not anymore.\\n\\n\\nBelow is important information and reminders:\\n\\n\\nLocation: 1400 18th Ave S Building, Suite 2000, Nashville, TN 37212\\n\\n\\nDress: Business casual attire (This includes items such as dress pants, khakis, polos and dress shirts)\\n\\n\\nImportant Dates:\\n\\n\\nVanderbilt University is off for Spring Break March 5th - March 13th. No internships will take place these days.\\n\\n\\nAll internships end by Thursday, April 28th.\\n\\n\\nImportant COVID-19 Information: Attached is a document outlining the COVID-19 guidelines all Vanderbilt University students must follow, including Next Steps interns and job coaches while at internship sites. Please note these may change given the evolving nature of the pandemic and any changes will be communicated to internship sites, interns, and job coaches as needed.\\n\\n\\nCareer Development Resource Guide: I am also attaching the Next Steps Career Development Resource guide that outlines student expectations and provides helpful information and resources for site supervisors.\\n\\n\\nInternship Coordinator: Lynda Tricia is the coordinator for this internship and is the main point of contact for any questions or concerns that arise.\\n\\n\\nFinally, below you will find everyone's contact information for your convenience.\\n\\n\\nContacts:\\n\\n\\nIntern: Jonathan Wade, jonathan.j.wade@vanderbilt.edu, 613-472-3867\\n\\n\\nSupervisor: Ruben Miller, ruben.k.miller@vanderbilt.edu, 216-574-3176\\n\\n\\nJob Coach: Jessica Cho, jessica.cho@vanderbilt.edu, 615-999-1134\\n\\n\\nInternship Coordinator: Lynda Tricia, lynda.z.tricia@vanderbilt.edu, 606-415-9999\\n\\n\\nPlease let us know if there are any questions. Thank you!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt - Safety Guidelines for Internships\\nMore information on Vanderbilt’s Health and Safety Protocols can be found here: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/coronavirus/community/undergraduate-students/\\nMasks: All Next Steps interns and job coaches must wear masks indoors at internships even if the jobsite does not require masks.\\nInterns and job coaches should have a well-fitted mask that completely covers your nose and mouth, preferably a KN95, KF94 or FFP2 version.\\nLunch Breaks: If an intern or job coach needs a lunch break, they can remove their mask just when they eat or drink. They must be physically distanced from other co-workers when eating. \\nSymptom Monitoring: All interns and job coaches must be free of ANY symptoms related to COVID-19 to go to the internship. If an intern or job coach has symptoms, they should stay home, notify the Next Steps staff and internship supervisor, and get tested at Vanderbilt Student Health or with their medical provider.\\nAccording to the CDC, symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. These include:\\n* Fever or chills\\n* Cough\\n* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\\n* Fatigue\\n* Muscle or body aches\\n* Headache\\n* New loss of taste or smell\\n* Sore throat\\n* Congestion or runny nose\\n* Nausea or vomiting\\n* Diarrhea\\n\\n\\nIf an intern or job coach tests positive: If an intern or job coach receives a COVID-19 positive test result, regardless of vaccination status, they should complete the following webform. The webform goes directly to the Vanderbilt Command Center.\\nThe intern or job coach will receive direct communication from the Command Center about their isolation (if they tested positive) or quarantine period (if considered a close contact) and will be instructed to contact Student Health or Occupational Health if they develop symptoms.\\nClose Contact/Quarantine: Interns or job coaches who are a close contact of someone who tests positive should complete the following webform. The webform goes directly to the Command Center.\\n* Close contacts who are unvaccinated will quarantine for 10 days based on CDC guidance.\\no Additional requirements are in place for days 10 to 14 following exposure including:\\n* For days 10 to 14 after last exposure, unvaccinated Vanderbilt community members identified as close contacts must not unmask at any time in public.\\n* Individuals should eat alone or complete any activities alone that require removing a mask in a private space during those four days between day 10-14.\\n* Close contacts who are vaccinated and asymptomatic will not have to quarantine but are recommended to monitor their symptoms and to get a COVID-19 test 5-7 days after last exposure. If asymptomatic, testing can be done at the VU testing center. If individuals develop symptoms, they should test at Student Health, Occupational Health or VUMC or other testing location in the community.\\n* Close contacts who are vaccinated and symptomatic may have to quarantine based on severity of symptoms and specific living situations. This determination will be made by their medical provider in consultation with the Command Center.\\nJob Coaching Supports: If a job coach tests positive and is unable to provide on-site supports, Next Steps staff will follow the procedures outlined below.\\n1. Identify another job coach or Next Steps staff member who can provide job coaching on-site during some of the student’s internship hours.\\n2. Identify another job coach or staff member who can check-in virtually with the student and supervisor during their shift. \\n3. Or, work with the student and supervisor to ensure natural supports are in place if the student must work without support of a job coach during that time period.\""
